## C++ Collection Framework

In the realm of C++, we don't have a specific "Collection Framework" like Java, but fear not, we have our own way of managing groups of objects effectively.

## Collection Framework Used in This Project

### In **Graph.cpp**

- Vector
- List
- Stack
- Map (using std::unordered_map)

### In **Heap.cpp**

- Map (using std::unordered_map)
- Vector

## Data Structures

In the world of data structures, we're all about organizing information to make it super useful.

### Array

In C++, we often use the dynamic array, similar to Java's ArrayList. It's flexible and stores data in contiguous memory locations.

### Hashmap

We've got our own version of key-value pairs called `std::unordered_map`. It's like a HashMap in Java.

### Linked List

For stacks and other data structures, we use linked lists. Think of it as Last In, First Out (LIFO) in action.

### Heap

Our heap structure is based on a combination of vectors and unordered maps. It's like a tree where everything is neatly organized.

### Stack

We make good use of linked lists to implement the stack data structure, just like in Java.

### Graph

A complex structure indeed! Our graph consists of vertices and edges connecting them. We build this using vectors and unordered maps.

So there you have it, the C++ version of your Collection Framework and Data Structures. We may not call it a "Collection Framework," but we've got the tools to handle data like pros!
